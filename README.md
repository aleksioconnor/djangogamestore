## 2. Goal
In this project, we will build an online gamestore utilizing django and jQuery. All memebers of our group have previous experience in front-end development, but no prior experience in developing with django. Learning goals include but are not restricted to learning the django framework, gain a deeper understanding of the jQuery framework, learn to use payment systems within a web project and learn to work efficiently with version control and small scale development projects. Technical goals include developing a stable, secure and easy-to-use online game store. We also plan to make the web platform visually compelling and user friendly. We have little experience with deploying to Heroku, so we look forward to working with the platform. 

## 3. Development and plans
Our aim is to implement all mandatory features and in addition most of the extra features.
### 3.1 Technology stack
The project will generally utilize JavaScript, jQuery HTML, CSS and Django. In addition, we will be using the node packet manager to allow the use of Gulp. Gulp will be used to automate the build process. We will test the compatibility of our stack with Heroku during the hello-world deployment and make further changes if necessary.
### 3.2 Outline of user interface
We have come up with an initial outline of what our web-game store will look like.

## 4. Process and time schedule
### 4.1 Time schedule
We will begin on the project on 9.1 at 13:30. During the christmas holidays all group members will familiarize themselves with the django framework so we can begin efficient development on the 9.1. We will begin by configuring the project and deploying a simple hello-world application to Heroku. Below is pictured a rough outline of our project plan:

| Week | Goal | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 2    | Configuration, initial deployment, simple communication between backend and frontend | |
| 3    | Backend | Work with API points and get backend up and running smoothly, configure basic database structure |
| 4    | Authentication and payment system | Authentication, basic player and developer functionalities, payment system |
| 5    | MVP | Achieve a MVP version of the application to enable future product development |
| 6    | Further development phase | Implement additional features, polish UI and testing |
| 7    | Further development phase | Implement additional features, polish UI, testing and writing final documentation |
| 8    | Returning the project | Deadline at 19.2 midnight (end of period three) |

### 4.2 Process
We will work using a backlog and assign tasks to team members. We will be using feature branches throughout the project, applying peer reviewing before merging features into the master branch. We will meet weekly to review changes, log process and plan for the future week. Communication will be enabled through instant messaging in addition to face-to-face meetings.

## 5. Testing
We will be implementing unit tests to critical functions throughout the project. A testing framework is under consideration and if implemented we are aiming for at least a 50% code coverage - we are not applying full unit testing due to limited resources. We will also apply penetration testing on week 6 to ensure our project meets the required security standards. The user interface will be subject to iterative testing and will be developed throughout the project.

## 6. Risk analysis
We are concerned about the project not progressing according to our schedule. Due to the nature of software projects, we are prepared for some delays or unexpected problems. We acknowledge that we are faced with a tight schedule, and we might have to compromise some features we wish to implement. To prevent delays affecting the outcome of our project we will review progress in weekly meetings.
