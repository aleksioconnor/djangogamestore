## 2. Goal
In this project, we will build an online gamestore utilizing django and jQuery. All memebers of our group have previous experience in front-end development, but no prior experience in developing with django. Learning goals include but are not restricted to learning the django framework, gain a deeper understanding of the jQuery framework, learn to use payment systems within a web project and learn to work efficiently with version control and small scale development projects. Technical goals include developing a stable, secure and easy-to-use online game store. We also plan to make the web platform visually compelling and user friendly. We have little experience with deploying to Heroku, so we look forward to working with the platform. 

## 3. Plans
We will use the node packet manager for organizing front-end dependancies. For the backend we will use Django. The front

## 4. Process and time schedule
### 4.1 Time schedule
We will begin on the project on 9.1 at 13:30. During the christmas holidays all group members will familiarize themselves with the django framework so we can begin efficient development on the 9.1. We will begin by configuring the project and deploying a simple hello-world application to Heroku. Below is pictured a rough outline of our project plan:

| Week | Goal | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 2    | Configuration, initial deployment, simple communication between backend and frontend | |
| 3    | Backend | Work with API points and get backend up and running smoothly, configure database |
| 4    | Authentication | Authentication, basic player and developer functionalities and other front end features |
| 5    | MVP | Achieve a MVP version of the application to enable future product development |
| 6    | Further development phase | Implement additional features and testing |
| 7    | Further development phase | Implement additional features and testing |
| 8    | Returning the project | Deadline at 19.2 midnight (end of period three) |

### 4.2 Process
We will work using a backlog and assign tasks to team members. We will be using feature branches throughout the project, applying strict peer reviewing before merging features into the master branch. We will meet weekly to log process and plan for the future week. 

## 5. Testing
We will be implementing unit tests to critical functions throughout the project. We are aiming for at least a 50% code coverage - we are not applying full unit testing due to limited resources. We will also apply penetration testing on week 6 to ensure our project meets the required security standards.

## 6. Risk analysis
We are concerned about the project not progressing according to our schedule. Due to the nature of software projects, we are prepared for some delays or unexpected problems. We acknowledge that we are faced with a tight schedule, and we might have to compromise some features we wish to implement.
